This blog is created by following this tutorial, [Create a Next.js App](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app). 

Next.js is a flexible **React framework** that gives you buildling blocks to create fast **web applications**. 

You can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, integrations - all while improving the developer and end-user experience. 

I highly recommend that everyone checks it out.
